# Stock Prediction and Automated Trading Models

## Introduction

This repository contains implementations of two advanced models for stock price prediction and automated trading:

1. **Price Prediction Model:** Uses a transformer-based neural network to forecast future stock prices with high accuracy, utilizing technical indicators and historical price data.
2. **PPO-based Trading Environment:** Employs a reinforcement learning agent (PPO) to make real-time trading decisions (Buy, Sell, Hold) in a simulated trading environment, aiming to maximize cumulative rewards based on market conditions.

Both models serve distinct yet complementary purposes, offering robust tools for financial analysis and automated trading strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the models is available at: [XNAS ITCH Dataset](https://databento.com/datasets/XNAS.ITCH)

## Model Checkpoints

The model checkpoints are available on Hugging Face: [Stock Recommendation with Transformer](https://huggingface.co/barghavani/Stock_recommendation_with_transformer/resolve/main/transformer_model%20(1).keras)

## Colab Notebook
